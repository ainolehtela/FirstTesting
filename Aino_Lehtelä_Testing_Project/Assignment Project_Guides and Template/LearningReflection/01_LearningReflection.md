    My experience was great. It was interesting and educational. 
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
    I used the given templates and instructions, which helped me to understand the tasks. Even with the provided information, there was a lot to think about on my own. It gave me a much better understanding than just reading and listening about testing. However, because I am new to this topic, there were many things I wasn't sure I was doing right, but I did my best.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
    I don't have recommendations  


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
    Visual studio code

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
    I didn't find any trouble. I used information that could be found in this folder and on the course page.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
    I didn't find any trouble using Github. I have used it before in my previous courses. 
 

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
    I have understood that Robot Framework is beginner-friendly, and because of that, I might select it. However, I do not have experience in automating tests, and because of this, I am not sure.
